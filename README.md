# backdraft

## a JavaScript library for building browser-hosted user interfaces


  * employs a familiar, frugal, and powerful  API that includes *declarative composition*
  * small--about 1000 lines of pure, modern JavaScript
  * faster than almost all and *as fast as any* component-construction library
  * *no* compilation step required
  * *zero* external dependencies in the library code
  * FreeBSD licensed
  
backdraft fundamentally changes the mental model of browser programming by lifting the programmer out of the HTML/DOM
tar pit into a modern and rich programming environment.

**Program the browser with a programming language that uses markup rather than the other way around!**
