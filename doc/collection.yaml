  `Collection` defines the property ./collection (an array). When rendered, `Collection` manages a collection of homogeneous child components to ensure there is a 1-to-1, onto mapping between each item in ./collection and each child component. If the ./collection is watchable, then if/when the array changes size, the rendered children components are automatically adjusted (inserted/deleted) to maintain the 1-to-1, onto mapping.

  The example [[Polygraph]http://backdraftjs.org/examples/polygraph/index.html] demonstrates Collection.

    Creates a new Collection instance.

    Keyword argument `collection` initializes the ./collection property; see ./collection.

    Keyword argument `childType` gives the constructor (class) for a component type that is used to create children. See ./insChild.

  sum: >
    creates and inserts a child component into the children collection
  sig:

  d:

    `insChild` creates a new component of type `kwargs.childType`. The constructor arguments

    `{index: i, mix: {collection: this.collection}}`

    are provided, where `this.collection` is the value of ./collection. Children component types should be designed so they synchronize their presentation/semantics with `collection[i]`. `Collection` guarantees that a particular child instance is always associated with the same item in ./collection.

  - i:
    - >
      It is the responsibility of the child to watch for mutations on the particular `collection` item to which it is associated. If the items in `collection` mutate during the lifetime of a `Collection` instance, then it is important the `collection` be set to a .../types.Watchable type.

props:
- name: collection
  jstype: rww, array
  sum: the data that is associated with each child component
  d:
  - >
    Each child component is associated with a single item in `collection`. See ./insChild for details.

    If the array is watchable, then `Collection` will ensure that its children are inserted/deleted if/when `collection` changes size.

    - This is a protected property and is not intended to be accessed by client code.
